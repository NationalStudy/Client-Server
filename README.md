Console chat on Ruby

http://www.sitepoint.com/ruby-tcp-chat/

Today, we are going to build a little TCP ruby chat application using the ruby standard library Socket. I’m using ruby 2.0.0, and Ubuntu Linux 12.04LTS, but it should work on Mac OS too. I haven’t tried it on Windows.  First a short overview of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):  TCP is one of the core protocols of the Internet protocol suite (IP), and is so common that the entire suite is often called TCP/IP. Web browsers use TCP when they connect to servers on the World Wide Web, and it is used to deliver email and transfer files from one location to another.
